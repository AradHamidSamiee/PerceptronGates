***This is a simple neural network (with no layers and biases) to learn boolean gates.***

Since it is an unbiased model, it can not learn XOR and NAND, but it can learn AND, OR and XNOR and it learns'em fast. (In less than 20 Epochs)

Weird enough you may want to set the LEARNING RATE to (-0.1) since the weights are set randomly by each initialization and they are all positive values.

***The ONE and ONLY library used in this project is random.py***

***Run TRON.py to start the training and put your boolean logic data in stdo.csv*** (or if you already have your data in a .csv file, you may want to run the csvStandardize.py first)
